This error typically occurs when there's a mismatch between the Expo SDK version specified in your `package.json` and the version actually installed.  It can also happen due to corrupted cache or incorrect configuration within the Expo CLI or your project setup.  The error message itself is often unhelpful, simply stating failure during the build process without specifying the root cause.
