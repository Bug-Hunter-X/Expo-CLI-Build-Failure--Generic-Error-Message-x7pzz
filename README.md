# Expo CLI Build Failure: Generic Error Message

This repository demonstrates a common issue when building Expo projects using the Expo CLI: a generic error message that doesn't provide enough debugging information.  The error message itself is often unhelpful, making it difficult to diagnose the problem. This example focuses on common causes and provides solutions.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Try running `expo prebuild` or `expo build:ios` (or `expo build:android`).
4. Observe the generic error message provided by the Expo CLI.

## Potential Causes and Solutions

* **SDK Version Mismatch:** Ensure the Expo SDK version specified in `package.json` matches the installed version. Run `expo upgrade` to check and update as needed.
* **Corrupted Cache:** Clear the Expo CLI cache using `expo start --clear`. 
* **Incorrect Configuration:** Review the project configuration (e.g., `app.json`, `eas.json`) for any errors or inconsistencies.
* **Missing Dependencies:** Verify all necessary dependencies are installed (`npm install` or `yarn install`)
* **Incorrect file permissions:** This can happen if the project or files within it have incorrect permissions. Check file and folder permissions to ensure Expo has access to the necessary resources.
* **Hardware/Software Issues:** Rare but can occur; try rebuilding on a different machine or after restarting your computer.
